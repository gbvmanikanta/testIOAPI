True,True,True,pathtraver,Yes,Path Traversal,fileName = org.owasp.benchmark.helpers.Utils.TESTFILES_DIR + param;,fileName = org.owasp.benchmark.helpers.Utils.getSafeFilePath(param);,The code is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack as it directly concatenates user input 'param' with a file path. The fix is to use a safe method 'getSafeFilePath' to sanitize the input and prevent path traversal vulnerabilities.,
True,True,True,pathtraver,Yes,Path Traversal,fileName = org.owasp.benchmark.helpers.Utils.TESTFILES_DIR + param;,"fileName = new java.io.File(org.owasp.benchmark.helpers.Utils.TESTFILES_DIR, param).getCanonicalPath();",The code is vulnerable to Path Traversal attack as it directly concatenates user input with a base directory. The fix involves using the File class to safely resolve the file path.,
True,False,True,hash,Yes,Cookie Security Vulnerability,userCookie.setSecure(true);,"userCookie.setHttpOnly(true);
userCookie.setSecure(true);","The 'setSecure(true)' method sets the 'Secure' attribute of the cookie to ensure it is only sent over HTTPS. However, it is recommended to also set the 'HttpOnly' attribute to prevent client-side scripts from accessing the cookie. This helps mitigate XSS attacks.",
True,False,True,trustbound,Yes,Cookie Security Issue,userCookie.setDomain(new java.net.URL(request.getRequestURL().toString()).getHost());,userCookie.setDomain(request.getServerName());,"The vulnerable code is setting the cookie domain based on the request URL, which can lead to security issues. The fix is to set the cookie domain using the server name instead.",
